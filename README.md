# project_3
The final project of the VU Full Stack Bootcamp

This repository is essentially a silo-ed front-end repository for the react part of my final project.

It should be noted that, the 'react-complete-guide' repo. is also part of such efforts to understand all of the moving parts of this project. The time invested there represented a refresher on React.js for me.
